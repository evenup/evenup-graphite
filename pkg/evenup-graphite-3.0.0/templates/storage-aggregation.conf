#  xFilesFactor should be a floating point number between 0 and 1, and specifies
#    what fraction of the previous retention levelâ€™s slots must have non-null 
#    values in order to aggregate to a non-null value. The default is 0.5.
#  aggregationMethod specifies the function used to aggregate values for the 
#    next retention level. Legal methods are average, sum, min, max, and 
#    last. The default is average.

#  [all_min]
#  pattern = \.min$
#  xFilesFactor = 0.1
#  aggregationMethod = min

#  The pattern above will match any metric that ends with .min.
